# Voice-Controlled Running Game  

This project was collaboratively designed by **jqorange** and **wl764**.  

The game allows players to control actions using voice frequencies:
- **Low-frequency input**: Crouch  
- **Medium-frequency input**: Attack  
- **High-frequency input**: Jump  

It features various obstacles, monsters, and collectibles, providing an engaging and dynamic gameplay experience.  
The game is implemented in Python using **Pygame** and **Pygame GUI**, with real-time voice frequency analysis using FFT, and is optimized to run on a **Raspberry Pi 4**.
